HTML-Dashboard version 0.03
===========================

This module tries to achive spreadsheet-like formatting for HTML tables.

The following features are supported:
- User-defined formatting of first, last, even, and odd rows or columns.
- Conditional formatting, based on the contents of each cell.
- Sorting (on any column or combination of cols, with user defined sort-order).
- Pagination of the data set.
- Definition of "views", i.e. restriction of the set of columns shown.
- User-defined column captions.
- On-the-fly formatting and collating of the data.

Rather than having to build up an HTML table from data, row by row and
cell by cell, applying formatting rules at every step, this module allows
the user to specify a set of simple rules with the desired formatting
options. The module will evaluate the rules and apply the formatting
options as necessary.
